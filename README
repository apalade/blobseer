Information on the module:
doc/ folder in this repo

Notes:
- src/ddfilter/ is not part of the actual module, however this filter was
developed so that integration with MonALISA (http://monalisa.caltech.edu) was
possible. More information on the MonALISA's website.
- the module is dependent on Boost C++ libraries, SOCI library for PostgreSQL 
database connection and, of course, BlobSeer
- "make leaks" under each subdirectory of src/ will check for memory leaks
- "make test" under each subdirectory of src/ will run unit tests
- "make" under src/ will compile everything (beware of dependencies)
